# BoardGameInventory.RedBadgeFInal
README file for Board Game Inventory Project that has kind of become a Nerd Collectible project
First two Commits are just setting up the project and getting it started. 
Third Commit is adding the data classes in for all of the Tables. 
Fourth commit was adding in the annotations for those classes. 
Fifth Commit added in Migrations as well as changing password information to not have to have as much password information.
Sixith Commit Added in the models for all of the tables in the Models Assembly.
Seventh commit was updating class names so that DBSets in the Indentity Models class would be easier to name. This was something that should have been done from the start but you live and learn. Also The Service layer for BoardGames was done here. 
Eight Commit added in the Services for RPG Books as well as updating the data layer where it was needed. 
Nineth commit was updating expansion areas which were causing some issues either with forgetting things that were needed or taking stuff out that wasn't entierly needed.
Tenth commit was creating the controller for Board Game.
Eleventh commit was creating the Expansion controller and changing some spelling errors that were on messages in Board Game stuff.

Thirteenth commit was adding the views for all of the controllers. 
Fourteenth commit was adding in navbar links to access the tables. 
Fifteenth commit was updating the Foreign Key to work along with minor other changes to the code. 
Sixteenth commit was finishing the MVP for the project. (Fist pump was accurate for the commit name for having the base done so early).
Seventeenth commit was adding in required tags where they would be needed in the models layer. 
Eighteenth commit was altering the views to better show what I wanted them too. 
Ninteenth commit was changing the board game time to play property from hours to minutes to provide ease of understanding on how long it would take to play. This meant alter code in the serives and controller layer as well as in the views. 
Twentieth commit was adding for the enums as well as making display names for the enums.
Twentyfirst commit added a GameID to edit expansion to change what board game that expansion was attached to in case a mistake was made entering it. 
Twentysecond and twentythird commits were just merging branches together. 
Twentyfourth commit made small changes to the views again.
Twentyfifth commit was starting up $)k stuff by adding in the data, model and service layer.

Thirtythird commit was adding a list to boardgame that would list out the expansions that a particular board game had. 
Thirtyfourth commit was merging branches again. 
Thirtyfifth commit was adding background image in.
Thirtysixth commit was making other minor changes that were changing something and then changing it back (forced commit even though nothing really changed).
ThirthSeventh commit was deploying to Azure.
Thirtheighth commit is adding the README file which I always seem to forget to do early. 


More things will change on the project as there are several things that I would like to add to this both table wise and to make something easier from a user perspective.
Tables that I would like to add are a Funko Pop table, a VideoGame Table, Lego Table, Comic Book/Graphic Novel Table, and a Kickstarter Table. 
Things I would like to add to the already existing table would be a drop down menu that is populated by items from another table to make it easier for linking one table to another as well as doing more stuff with the 40k army stuff.


Overall I am super proud of this project and super happy with how it was turned out so far and look forward to making more changes to it over time to really flush it out.
